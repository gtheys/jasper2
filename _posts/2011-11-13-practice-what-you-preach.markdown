> I am a false prophet! God is a superstition! I am a false prophet! God is a superstition! I am a false prophet! God is a superstition! [Eli Sunday in "There will be blood"](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0469494/quotes?qt0441793)

After working as a Scrum Master and blogging about it I took a small break. I felt like telling the same stories other people were telling but in different words. And those other people told it better ;)

<!--more--> 

But I didn't have experience in the things I wanted to blog about. I wanted to blog about program management but never have been a program manager. So I couldn't start blogging about the disconnect between management on strategic level and Agile. I only had a one sided view.

I can relate to some views of [Jurgen Appelo's ](http://www.jurgenappelo.com/)[Management 3.0](http://www.amazon.com/o/ASIN/0321712471?tag=adapas-20)book but this was all in the domain I knew. Building web sites or online applications in environments where clients don't know what they want, management can't decide where they want to go.

Now after reading a few months the blog [Herding Cats](http://herdingcats.typepad.com/) I can relate to Glenn B. Alleman where he warns for "the False Agile Prophets". But in his domain DoD it isn't just realistic to go ["Full Agile"](http://vimeo.com/3945205).

I'm not yet a program manager but I accepted to work as project manager in a relatively unknown domain. I need to be [ISAE3402 compliant](http://isae3402.com/). But more to come in later blog posts.

In the end it's all about practicing what you're preaching.
