Like everybody I want to start to set myself some goals for 2014. The last 2 years consisted of a lof of soul searching. Nearing fourty means that you start to look backwards and forward.

I have only 1 goal for 2014 and that implement some [good habbit's](http://www.amazon.com/The-Power-Habit-What-Business/dp/1400069289).

### Reading habit

I used to be an avid reader I read fiction and non fiction. Just about everything I can lay my hands on. Somewhere in my life I stopped doing this. 

I'm going to stop to take my laptop to bed and start reading books again before I go to sleep. I already started in a new book: [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11.The_Hitchhiker_s_Guide_to_the_Galaxy). You can follow my progress on this habit via [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/4937856-geert-theys)

### Exercise habit

I love Thai boxing. I have a gym at 1 km from my door. If I feel like it or not I'm going! 

### Write and publish content

I have had a lot of half assed attempts to write more. I started the habbit to write down on a daily basis whatever I can think of. But the most important is to publish!

I will start publishing 1 post per week on this blog.


### Write more code

I have 10 years of experience as developer and several years as an manager. For a few years I haven't written a single line of code. I'm finalizing a [rails](http://rubyonrails.org) app that will get launched in February 2014 as proof of concept in the healthcare.

I have some other ideas on new projects which I will pick up after this one. To feed my writing habit I will blog about several technical topics I meet on my way.
